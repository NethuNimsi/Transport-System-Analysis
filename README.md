# Transport-System-Analysis
A comprehensive data analytics project focused on analyzing automobile and transport system datasets using R programming and RStudio. This project demonstrates advanced statistical modeling and data science techniques applied to real-world transportation data.
The analysis includes multiple regression modeling to identify relationships between vehicle attributes and performance metrics, extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and trends in the dataset, and sophisticated data visualizations using ggplot2 and other R packages to effectively communicate insights. Key statistical techniques employed include correlation analysis, hypothesis testing, predictive modeling, and residual analysis to ensure model validity.
The project delivers actionable insights into vehicle performance factors, fuel efficiency patterns, and transportation system optimization opportunities. All findings are documented in a detailed business analytics report with professional visualizations, statistical summaries, and data-driven recommendations for stakeholders in the automotive and transportation industry.
